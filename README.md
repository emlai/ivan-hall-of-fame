# [IVAN Hall of Fame](https://ivan-hall-of-fame.herokuapp.com)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/emlai/ivan-hall-of-fame.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/emlai/ivan-hall-of-fame)

This is a global hall of fame for the game [Iter Vehemens ad Necem][1], aka
IVAN. This project uses [Rails][3], a server-side web framework for the Ruby
programming language. To start up the server, make sure you have Ruby and Rails
installed, then execute `rails server`. Use `rails test` to run the tests.

A fork of IVAN with integration for this project (i.e. automatic high-score
syncing) is being implemented [here][2].
